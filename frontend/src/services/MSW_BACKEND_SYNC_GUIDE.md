# 🔄 MSW-Backend API Synchronization Guide

## 🎯 **Purpose**
This guide ensures MSW (Mock Service Worker) handlers stay synchronized with real backend APIs, enabling isolated frontend/backend development.

## 📊 **Current Sync Status: ✅ FULLY SYNCHRONIZED & STABLE**

**Last Updated:** December 30, 2024  
**Status:** 🟢 **Fully Stable & Ready for Backend Integration**

### ✅ **Latest Updates (December 30, 2024 - Sophisticated Availability Engine)**

#### **🚀 MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: Sophisticated Room Availability System**
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Date-based conflict detection using proper overlap logic `(requestStart < resEnd) && (resStart < requestEnd)`
- **✅ ENHANCED**: Real reservation record creation in Enhanced Reservation Wizard to support future availability checks
- **✅ IMPROVED**: Sophisticated availability filtering that properly handles different date ranges
- **✅ FIXED**: Room availability now correctly shows different results for different date ranges
- **✅ OPTIMIZED**: Reduced console log noise while maintaining essential debugging information

#### **🎯 Key Availability Engine Features**
1. **Date-Based Conflict Detection**: Checks for overlapping reservations using sophisticated date math
2. **Active Reservation Filtering**: Only considers reservations with `status: 'active'` or `reservationStatus: 'active'`
3. **Real Reservation Creation**: Enhanced Reservation Wizard now creates actual reservation records for future availability checks
4. **Multiple Validation Layers**: Capacity check + Status check + Date conflict check
5. **Detailed Conflict Reporting**: Returns information about conflicting reservations

#### **🧪 Test Scenarios Now Supported**
- ✅ **Same room, different dates** → Available (no conflict)
- ❌ **Same room, overlapping dates** → Unavailable (date conflict detected)
- ✅ **Different rooms, same dates** → Available (no room conflict)
- ✅ **Partial date overlap** → Unavailable (sophisticated overlap detection)

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation**
```typescript
// Sophisticated availability engine function
const checkRoomAvailabilityForDates = (room: Room, checkInDate: string, checkOutDate: string) => {
  // Find all active reservations for this room
  const roomReservations = mockReservations.filter(res => 
    res.roomId === room._id && 
    (res.status === 'active' || res.reservationStatus === 'active')
  );

  // Check for date overlaps using proper date math
  const hasOverlap = (requestStart < resEnd) && (resStart < requestEnd);
  
  return {
    isAvailable: conflictingReservations.length === 0,
    conflictingReservations
  };
};
```

### Reservation Notes Handling

- When creating a reservation (via POST /api/reservations or /api/reservations/multi-room), the 'notes' field from the request should be saved in the reservation object and returned in the response.
- If notes are missing after creation, check the handler logic to ensure the field is copied.
- This is a common source of confusion if the UI expects notes but the backend/MSW does not persist them.
